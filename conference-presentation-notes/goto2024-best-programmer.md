# traits

## getting the job done
 
### focus on starting (instead of procrastinating)
- anything other than production can fall into this
  - ex: research, preparation
- not everything needs to be perfect
  - know that you can rewrite (it doesn't have to be good or even right...)
  - embrace the frustration of messing things up (this is learning)

### focus on the outcome, rather than the product
- the code isn't the product, just the means
- balance quality with ruthlessness


### knowing the domain
  - watching for user frustration

### solving for now...
  - only look for unenough samples before generalizing
  - ...but, it depends on the release cycle...
  - code needs to "earn its' place in the codebase"

## choose the right tool...
  * for the product, not the team...

### expected lifetime
  * project can outlive team
  * data can outlive organization

### prototyping
  * start with something hideous which provides value
  - ...and clean it up over time
  * things which support easier start time are very valuable

### spike and stabilize
  * all code is speculative...  
  * if we think we need to change something later, we can start by making the thing easier to change (ex: separated from other things)

## CUPID
https://cupid.dev/
  - composeable
  - unix-like (only one thing)
  - predicatable
  - idiomatic (feels natural/obvious)
  - domain-based
  (the last two are perhaps an either-or situation...)

### do the 'simplest' not the easiest
